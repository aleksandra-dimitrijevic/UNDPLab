          UNDP and UNFPA in Serbia are preparing a National Human Development Report focused on demographic trends,
          gathering a group of domestic and international experts to work on various dimensions of current demographic
          change. The NHDR has two underlying themes. Depopulation is understood as an inevitable, though not
          necessarily a catastrophic trend. Serbian society would need to adapt to it in at least two ways: (1) By
          building its existing human capital and enabling every individual to be fully and productively integrated in
          society, particularly those that are at the margin of economic progress and public policies, and (2) By
          adjusting public policies across a wide range of sectors to the new demographic reality.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The NHDR aims to offer a new policy paradigm on demographic trends, one that would include pro-natalist but
          also other policies relevant for building human capital and adjusting to a less populous and older, but more
          educated and productive society. It offers policy options and proposals and contours of a new policy discourse
          on depopulation. It contains nine chapters as follows.&nbsp;

          showing that depopulation is not a unique historical experience: it occurred in earlier periods and it need
          not imply doom for the future. They warn on the role and responsibility of EU countries who attract labor from
          Serbia and other countries of the region. This process may undermine the long-term economic and social
          development of the Balkan region.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Vladimir Nikitović analyzes demographic trends in Serbia, showing that in any scenario, fertility rates will
          not increase enough to compensate for population losses. Therefore, an active immigration policy is most
          likely Serbia&rsquo;s future. He also shows that depopulation in Serbia has subnational dynamics. While more
          developed parts of the country are facing population increase, depopulation is markedly a characteristic of
          less developed ones. He calculates regional Human Development Indices to show deep inequalities that drive
          internal migrations and depopulation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mihail Arandarenko analyzes migration and labor markets in the EU and Serbia. He demonstrates several shifts
          in migration patterns: from Western Europe to Eastern and Central Europe; from low- and high-skill to
          medium-skill emigration; from family reunification to work migration and from longer-term to circular patterns
          of emigration. The Serbian labor market is characterized by duality and lower wages, especially for low- and
          medium-skilled workers in the private sector, and these are key factor of labor migrations. The lengthy
          school-to-work transition and a low general level of good-job creation in the country further contribute to
          migration flows.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dragan Stanojević is analyzing population dynamics from the family life perspective. Low-paid insecure jobs
          often occupied by women are a barrier to increasing fertility. Job security and stable income, along with
          independent housing, are key factors in deciding to start a family and have children, and these expectations
          are more pronounced with increasing levels of youth education. The Serbian work culture, as well as childcare
          facilities, are less than family and parent friendly. Gender, parenting and family related values are
          incoherent, while there is a pronounced gender disbalance related to childbearing and housekeeping work. From
          the family perspective, Serbia&rsquo;s society appears less than friendly and supportive (although it highly
          values family life as such).&nbsp;

          Dragica Pavlović Babić is working on human capital, analyzing how the educational system is adapting to
          demographic trends and what would be the desired directions for its future development. She shows the
          education system&rsquo;s response to a shrinking student population and new demands on the labor market,
          particularly discussing de-concentration and regional dispersion of educational institutions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Branislav Antonić is analyzing the future of Serbia&rsquo;s cities. He shows that mid-sized cities are key for
          future demographic and socio-economic development of the country. Geographic position, infrastructure and
          urban planning play a crucial role in tackling depopulation. Some locations in Serbia are already adjusting to
          new demographics and these sites are used as experimentation resources in his analysis. His analysis points to
          various clusters of urban centers and policies adjusted to them.&nbsp;

          Gordana Matković is focused on ageing. She concludes that the biggest challenge is the increase in the number
          and share of the "oldest old" (80+). She is positive that institutional innovations and adjustments have the
          potential to mitigate negative aspects of population ageing. She discusses in detail possible policy responses
          (options) in the fields of social protection, health and pension systems.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Željka Stamenković is analyzing health indicators and potential healthcare system responses to demographic
          trends. She discusses health related factors behind low fertility and high mortality. The role of healthcare
          and educational institutions as well as public administration is crucial in mitigating various health related
          risks. Learning from our past and from comparative experiences, she provides a list of possible policy options
          for future social dialogues.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jelisaveta Petrović links current demographic trends to climate change and environmental degradation. She
          analyzes various climate change and environmental (particularly air pollution) scenarios and the possible
          impacts on the three components of depopulation - mortality, birth rate and migration. She is focused on the
          socio-economic consequences of climate change and air pollution and links social and environmental science to
          detect the magnitude and structure of the problem as well as to provide possible policy options.&nbsp;
